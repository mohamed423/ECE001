		<h1>Microsoft Windows</h1>
		<p class="test2">Microsoft Windows has existed in one form or another since 1985, and it remains the most popular operating system for home and office computers. Its latest versions, including Windows 10, are also used on some tablets, and the OS is used on some web and number-crunching server computers as well. Computers from a wide variety of manufacturers can use Windows.</p>
		<p class="test2">Initial versions of Windows worked with an earlier Microsoft operating system called MS-DOS, providing a modern graphical interface on top of DOS's traditional text-based commands. Signature features of Microsoft Windows's user interface include windows themselves â€“ rectangle-shaped, on-panel screens that represent individual applications. The Windows Start menu has helped generations of users find programs and files on their devices.</p>
		<p class="test2">However, efforts to use versions of the Windows OS for smartphones have been less successful.</p>

		<h2>Two of those features:</h2>
		<h3>Control Panel:</h3>
		<p>The Control Panel is a collection of tools to help you configure and manage the resources on your computer. You can change settings for printers, video, audio, mouse, keyboard, date and time, user accounts, installed applications, network connections, power saving options, and more.</p>
		<h3>Desktop:</h3>
		<p>The desktop is a fundamental part of the default GUI (graphical user interface) in Windows. It is a space where you can organize applications, folders, and documents, which appear as icons. Your desktop is always in the background, behind any other applications you're running.</p>
		<p>When you power on your computer and log in to Windows, the first thing you see is your desktop background, icons, and the taskbar. From here, you can access the installed programs on your computer from the Start menu, or by double-clicking any application shortcuts you may have on your desktop.</p></font>
