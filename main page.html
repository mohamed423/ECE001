		<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
		<h2>What is operating system?</h2>
		<p class="test2">An operating system, or "OS," is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop computer, tablet, and smartphone includes an operating system that provides basic functionality for the device.</p>
		<p class="test2">Common desktop operating systems include Windows, OS X, and Linux. While each OS is different, most provide a graphical user interface, or GUI, that includes a desktop and the ability to manage files and folders. They also allow you to install and run programs written for the operating system. Windows and Linux can be installed on standard PC hardware, while OS X is designed to run on Apple systems. Therefore, the hardware you choose affects what operating system(s) you can run.</p>
		<p class="test2">operating system serves as a computer's fundamental user interface, it significantly affects how you interact with the device. Therefore, many users prefer to use a specific operating system. For example, one user may prefer to use a computer with OS X instead of a Windows-based PC. Another user may prefer an Android-based smartphone instead of an iPhone, which runs the iOS.</p>
		<p class="test2">An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.</p>

		<h3>some of important functions of an operating System:</h3>
		<p class="test2">• Memory Management</p>
		<p class="test2">• Processor Management</p>
		<p class="test2">• Device Management</p>
		<p class="test2">• File Management</p>
		<p class="test2">• Security</p>
		<p class="test2">• Control over system performance</p>
		<h3>Now let's discuss two function:</h3>
		<h4>1. Memory Management</h4></font>
		<p class="test2">Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address.</p>
		<p class="test2">Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it must in the main memory. An Operating System does the following activities for memory management </p>
		<font size="4"><h4>2. Device Management</h4></font>
		<p class="test2">An Operating System manages device communication via their respective drivers. It does the following activities for device management.</p>
		<p class="test2">Keeps tracks of all devices. Program responsible for this task is known as the I/O controller.</p>
		<p class="test2">Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.</p>
		<h2>What Operating Systems Do?</h2>
		<p class="test2">Operating systems define how a computer stores files, switches between different applications, manages memory, keeps itself secure, and interacts with peripherals like printers and cameras. Different operating systems take different approaches to all of these, which is why you normally can't run a Windows program on a Macintosh computer and why permissions look different on an Android phone than on an iPhone.</p>
