		<h2>history of iOS:</h2>
		<p>The iOS operating system was introduced without a proper name at the Macworld Conference, Expo with the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, but later became referred to as "OS X". A year later the name changed to "iPhone OS", and by 2010, with the release of the iPad, the name changed for the final time, to "iOS".</p>
		<p>Since 2010, iOS has been updated annually, with specific improvements announced at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. In 2016, Apple announced iOS 10, the latest version of the operating system to run across touchscreen Apple devices.</p>
		<h2>iOS Timeline:</h2>
		<p>iPhone OS 1.x. In 2007, this was the first version released by Apple, introducing a touch-centric system. When it was released, all that was said about this system was that it was the same operating system as Apple Desktops.</p>
		<p>iPhone OS 2.x. This system was released in 2008, alongside the iPhone 3G. Anyone still operating on a 1.x system was able to upgrade to 2.x, which introduced users to the new ‘App Store’ allowing for applications to be downloaded onto the iPhone and iPod Touch.</p>
		<p>iPhone OS 3.x. The release of the iPhone 3GS in 2009 came with the updated OS 3.x system. Apple added some new features, among the most valuable being MMS and the copy and paste feature.</p>
		<h2>How Much Does iOS Cost? How Often Is It Updated?</h2>
		<p>Apple does not charge for updates to the operating system. Apple also gives away two suites of software products with the purchase of iOS devices: The iWork suite of office apps-which includes a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software-and the iLife suite, which includes video-editing software, music-editing and creation software, and photo-editing software. Apple apps like Safari, Mail, and Notes ship with the operating system by default.</p>
		<p>Apple releases a major update to iOS once a year with an announcement at Apple's developer conference in early summer. It is followed by a release in early fall that is timed to coincide with the announcement of the most recent iPhone and iPad models. These free releases add major features to the operating system. Apple also issues bug fix releases and security patches throughout the year.</p></font>
