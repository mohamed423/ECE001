		<h1>Android</h1>

		<h2>The founding of Android:</h2>
		<p>In October 2003, well before the term “smartphone” was used by most of the public, and several years before Apple announced its first iPhone and its iOS, the company Android Inc was founded in Palo Alto, California. Its four founders were Rich Miner, Nick Sears, Chris White, and Andy Rubin. At the time of its public founding, Rubin was quoted as saying that Android Inc was going to develop “smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner’s location and preferences”.</p>
		<h2>What Is the Android Operating System?</h2>
		<p>The Android operating system is a mobile operating system that was developed to be primarily used for touchscreen devices, cell phones, and tablets. Its design lets users manipulate the mobile devices intuitively, with finger movements that mirror common motions, such as pinching, swiping, and tapping. Google also employs Android software in televisions, cars, and wristwatches—each of which is fitted with a unique user interface.</p>
		<p>Android is the most popular operating system in the world judging by the number of devices installed. Largely developed by Google, it's chiefly used on smartphones and tablets. Unlike iOS, it can be used on devices made by a variety of different manufacturers, and those makers can tweak parts of its interface to suit their own needs.</p>
		<p>Users can download custom versions of the operating system because large portions of it are open source, meaning anyone can legally modify it and publish their own. However, most people prefer to stick with the version that comes on their devices.</p>
		<p>Android, like iOS, comes with an application and media store called the Play Store built by Google. Some phone manufacturers and other organizations also offer their own stores to install software and media.</p>
		<h3>Google Services:</h3>
		<p>Because Google developed Android, it comes with a lot of Google app services installed right out of the box. Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Maps, and Google Now are all pre-installed on most Android phones.</p>
		<p>However, because Android can be modified, carriers can choose to change this. Verizon Wireless, for instance, has modified some Android phones to use Bing as the default search engine. You can also remove a Gmail account on your own from most Android phones.</p>
		<h3>Security:</h3>
		<p>Nearly all Android phones offer some level of security now, from fingerprint identification to facial recognition features. Most also support two-factor authentication processes, too and offer lock screen security options such as tracing a pattern over dots or inputting a PIN code or password to keep strangers from accessing a phone. You can also lock apps in different ways.</p></font>
